# Review Guidelines

Guidelines for peer reviewers evaluating submitted tasks.

## Reviewer Checklist
As a helpful tool to use while reviewing, we have a comprehensive reviewer checklist that covers all aspects that should be looked at during a review. This includes descritions of what we are looking for qualitatively, as well as assigns a severity level that establishes if an error for a given aspect of a submission should result in an Accept still, or if it always requires the submission to be sent back for revisions when encountered.

**Go to [Reviewer Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cFfpOxuciUGSH8ApNVeOtf5B2Cdopi5s6QL30tDg8AE/edit?tab=t.0)**


## Review Philosophy

As a reviewer, you're ensuring quality for the benchmark. Your goal is to:
- Catch issues before they enter the dataset
- Help contributors improve their tasks
- Maintain consistency across submissions

> **Remember:** Each review you conduct should be comprehensive and catch ALL present errors and issues with the task. Do not simply find the first error you come across and then immediately send it back for revision. Instead, **find all issues** during your review and give feedback on all elements found.

_If the EC addresses your comments, the task should be ready for acceptance, assuming no new issues appear. In other words, your feedback should be always clear, complete, and actionable._

## Review Checklist

### 1. Read the Task Description

### Authentic Prompt Styling

We have overhauled the way instructions are written. In Edition 2, the `instruction.md` file should index on **realistic prompts** that real users and engineers would use when interacting with coding agents in their daily life, and be as succinct as possible.

The instructions for every task should adhere to these six general principles:
1. Task instructions **must be concise.**
2. Task instructions **must be well specified.**
3. Task instructions **must be interesting.**
4. Task instruction **must not give answers, hints.**
5. Task instruction **must be unique.**
6. Task instruction **must use absolute paths.**

**Consult the [Prompt Styling Guide](/portal/docs/reference/prompt-styling) for further details on each core principle.**

### 2. Review Tests

- [ ] Every requirement has a corresponding test
- [ ] Tests have informative docstrings
- [ ] Tests verify behavior, not implementation
- [ ] No brittle string matching
- [ ] No hardcoded thresholds (or thresholds are reasonable)

### 3. Check Solution

- [ ] Solution demonstrates the process (not just outputs answer)
- [ ] Commands are deterministic
- [ ] Works in the provided environment

### 4. Verify Metadata

- [ ] Difficulty matches expected pass rate
- [ ] Category is appropriate
- [ ] Time estimates are realistic
- [ ] Timeout is sufficient but not excessive

### 5. Watch Agent Runs

On the task viewer:
- Watch the terminal recording
- If agent fails, is it failing for a **good reason**?
- Check the analysis for identified issues
- Read the debug pane

## Common Issues to Flag

### Task Description Problems

| Issue | What to Look For |
|-------|------------------|
| Ambiguous requirements | "Make it better", "fix the issues" |
| Missing output specs | Tests check files not mentioned |
| Relative paths | `./data/file.txt` instead of `/app/data/file.txt` |
| Implicit assumptions | Assumes knowledge not in instructions |

### Test Problems

| Issue | What to Look For |
|-------|------------------|
| Brittle tests | Exact string matching |
| Missing coverage | Requirements without tests |
| Order dependency | Tests that must run in sequence |
| Implementation testing | Parsing source code |

### Solution Problems

| Issue | What to Look For |
|-------|------------------|
| Hardcoded answers | `echo "42" > result.txt` |
| Non-deterministic | Uses random without seed |
| Incomplete | Missing steps |
| Over-complex | Unnecessarily convoluted |

## Specific Things to Watch

### Testing Behavior

> It is almost always better to test a behavior by actually running the code than trying to statically analyze it.

**Flag:** Tests that grep through source code looking for patterns.

### Tool Specifications

> Task instructions shouldn't mention specific tools unless there's a way to verify they were used.

**Flag:** "Use vim to edit the file" (can't verify vim was used).

### Randomness

> Tasks involving randomness MUST NOT assume the solution matches that same random order.

**Flag:** Tests that depend on specific `np.random.seed` values.

### Test Complexity

> Long test files are almost always wrong since more tests means more opportunities for error.

**Flag:** test_outputs.py with 20+ tests for a simple task.

### Data Formats

> Be especially paranoid about specifying data formats.

**Flag:** "Output a CSV" without specifying whether it needs headers.

### Anti-Cheating

Think about how agents could cheat:
- Decompile programs to find hidden answers
- Replace programs with dummy versions
- Delete or modify tests
- Access newer git commits

## Review Actions

### Approve

Task is ready. No issues found.

### Request Changes

Issues need fixing before acceptance. Be specific:
- What's wrong
- Where it is
- How to fix it

**Good feedback:**
> The test `test_output_format` on line 45 uses exact string matching. Please change to check for required fields instead, allowing for formatting variations.

**Bad feedback:**
> Tests need work.

**Extra things you can include**
- Point the submitter where can they found how to fix the issue or a place where they can see they are mistaken

> Check the New: Rubrics section in the trainig site

### Decline

Fundamental issues that can't be easily fixed:
- Too easy (> 80% pass rate consistently)
- Essentially duplicate of existing task
- Core concept is flawed

Explain clearly why, and whether revision could salvage it.
