# Defending Your Submission

How to respond to review feedback and appeal decisions.

## Responding to Feedback

### Read Carefully

Before responding:
1. Read each comment fully
2. Understand what's being asked
3. Consider if the feedback is valid
4. Check if you missed something

### Acknowledge Valid Points

If the reviewer is right:
```
"You're right, the test on line 45 uses brittle string matching. 
I've updated it to check for the presence of required fields instead."
```

### Explain Your Reasoning

If you disagree or need clarification:
```
"I chose to use exact string matching here because the output format
is strictly specified in the instructions (line 12). The agent is told
to output exactly 'status: success' - would checking for 'success' 
alone be acceptable, or should I clarify the instructions?"
```

### Ask Questions

If feedback is unclear:
```
"Could you clarify what you mean by 'tests are too strict'? 
Are you referring to the format checking or the value validation?"
```

## Making Changes

### Be Thorough

Address every point raised, not just some.

### Be Explicit

When you push changes, explain what you did:
```
Addressed review feedback:
- Line 45: Changed string match to field check
- Line 67: Added docstring to test_output
- task.yaml: Clarified output format requirement
```

### Don't Over-Engineer

Fix what's asked. Don't rewrite unrelated code.

## Disagreements

### When to Push Back

It's okay to disagree if:
- You have a valid technical reason
- The feedback misunderstands your approach
- The requested change would break something

### How to Push Back

Be respectful and provide evidence:

**Don't:**
```
"That's wrong. My approach is fine."
```

**Do:**
```
"I understand the concern about test brittleness, but in this case
the exact format is critical - the task specifically requires JSON
with these exact keys. Here's why I think the current test is 
appropriate: [explanation]. Would you like me to add a comment
explaining this, or do you still think I should change it?"
```

### Escalation

If you can't resolve disagreement with the reviewer:

1. **Document your position** clearly in the PR/submission
2. **Reach out on Slack** to `#ec-terminus-submission`
3. **Tag a lead** if needed

## Appeals

### When to Appeal

Appeal if:
- Task was declined but you believe it meets criteria
- Feedback is incorrect or unfair
- There's a misunderstanding about requirements

### How to Appeal

1. **Reply to the decision** with your reasoning
2. **Provide specific evidence** for your position
3. **Be professional** - appeals are reviewed by seniors
4. **Accept the outcome** - final decisions are final

### Appeal Template

```
I'd like to appeal this decision. Here's my reasoning:

**Reviewer said:** [quote feedback]

**My response:** [your explanation]

**Evidence:** [specific examples, references, etc.]

I believe this task should be [accepted/reconsidered] because [reason].
```

## Tips for Smooth Reviews

### Before Submission

- Run all checks locally
- Self-review against guidelines
- Have a colleague look at it

### During Review

- Respond promptly (within 1-2 days)
- Be collaborative, not defensive
- Ask questions early

### If Declined

- Take feedback seriously
- Consider if the task can be salvaged
- Learn from it for next time
- It's okay to start fresh

## Remember

Reviewers are on your side. They want tasks to succeed. Most feedback is meant to help you improve your submission, not reject it.

A collaborative attitude leads to faster acceptance.
