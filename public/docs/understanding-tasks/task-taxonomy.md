# Task Type Taxonomy

Each task must be labeled with a category from this taxonomy. The category describes the primary theme, topic, or activity in the task.

## Categories

### system-administration

Tasks involving OS-level configuration, user management, package management, processes, or installing, configuring, and bringing up services, networks, and environments.

**Examples:**
- Configure a systemd service
- Set up user permissions
- Install and configure Nginx

---

### build-and-dependency-management

Compile code, manage dependencies, build components.

**Examples:**
- Fix a broken build configuration
- Resolve dependency conflicts
- Set up a multi-stage Docker build

---

### data-processing

Tasks that transform, parse, filter, aggregate datasets or files and directories and generate derived output.

**Examples:**
- Parse and transform CSV data
- Aggregate log files
- Filter and sort JSON datasets

---

### games

Tasks centered on game-like or simulated environments, interactive puzzles, or simulation games that run in the terminal.

**Examples:**
- Complete a VimGolf challenge
- Solve a terminal-based puzzle
- Navigate a text adventure

---

### software-engineering

Tasks focused on developing or testing features and algorithms, fixing bugs and improving/optimizing an existing feature, implementing tests, or maintaining software projects.

**Examples:**
- Implement a caching algorithm
- Fix a race condition
- Optimize database queries

---

### machine-learning

Tasks requiring training, fine-tuning, running inference, or evaluating machine learning models, including dependency setup, running training loops, and managing data pipelines for ML tasks.

**Examples:**
- Fine-tune a model on custom data
- Debug a training pipeline
- Optimize inference performance

---

### debugging

Tasks that require identifying, diagnosing, and fixing errors in scripts, codebases, or system configurations.

**Examples:**
- Find and fix a memory leak
- Debug a failing test suite
- Diagnose a production crash

---

### security

Tasks related to cryptography, authentication, permissions, penetration-style tests, exploit, validate vulnerabilities, reverse engineering or security configuration.

**Examples:**
- Find a SQL injection vulnerability
- Configure secure TLS settings
- Reverse engineer a binary

---

### scientific-computing

Tasks using scientific libraries or workflows, such as numerical computation, simulations, or domain-specific research code.

**Examples:**
- Implement a numerical solver
- Debug a simulation
- Optimize a scientific computation

---

## Distribution Guidelines

To ensure benchmark diversity:

- **No single type** should exceed ~30% of total tasks
- **At least four types** should each represent ≥10%

## Choosing a Category

Pick the category that best describes the **primary** activity:

| If the task mainly involves... | Use category |
|--------------------------------|--------------|
| OS/server configuration | system-administration |
| Build systems, packages | build-and-dependency-management |
| ETL, file processing | data-processing |
| Interactive challenges | games |
| Code development, testing | software-engineering |
| ML model work | machine-learning |
| Finding/fixing bugs | debugging |
| Security issues | security |
| Scientific code | scientific-computing |

## Domain-Specific Tasks

If your tasks are designed for a particular domain (e.g., financial services), an additional taxonomy specific to that domain can be developed. Discuss with the team on Slack.
