# Welcome to TerminalBench

You've joined a community of experts pushing the boundaries of agentic AI. This documentation will help you get started and succeed as a contributor.

## What is TerminalBench?

TerminalBench is a benchmark for evaluating AI coding agents on real-world engineering tasks. Your job is to create tasks that challenge today's best models—tasks that require genuine engineering reasoning, multi-step problem solving, and practical skills.

> 💡 **Your work matters.** Every accepted task directly advances the development of AI coding agents by revealing their current limitations and pushing them to improve.

## How This Works

1. **You create tasks** — Engineering challenges that test AI capabilities
2. **AI agents attempt them** — We run frontier models against your tasks
3. **Results inform development** — Tasks that stump AI guide future improvements
4. **You get paid** — Accepted tasks earn payouts
