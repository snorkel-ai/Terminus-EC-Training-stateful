# Glossary

Key terms and definitions used throughout TerminalBench.

---

## A

### Agent
An AI system that can write, execute, and iterate on code autonomously. Unlike simple code completion, agents can plan multi-step solutions and recover from errors.

### Agentic AI
AI systems designed to take actions and make decisions autonomously rather than simply responding to prompts. Agentic coding AI can execute code, read results, and iterate.

---

## B

### Benchmark
A standardized set of tasks used to measure and compare the performance of AI systems. TerminalBench is a benchmark for coding agents.

### Branch
A separate line of development in Git. Each task should be developed on its own branch before being merged.

---

## C

### CI/CD
Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment. Automated processes that run tests and validations when you push code.

### Constraint
A limitation or requirement for a task solution, such as time complexity (O(n log n)) or space usage (constant space).

---

## D

### Difficulty Level
Classification of task complexity:
- **Easy:** 15-20 minutes, straightforward logic
- **Medium:** 20-35 minutes, requires planning
- **Hard:** 35-50 minutes, complex reasoning
- **Expert:** 50+ minutes, deep domain knowledge

### Domain
The area of expertise a task belongs to: algorithms, systems, web, data, devops, security, etc.

---

## E

### Edge Case
Input scenarios at the boundaries of expected behavior: empty arrays, maximum values, null inputs, etc.

### Expert Platform
The Snorkel platform where contributors manage tasks, track progress, and receive feedback.

---

## F

### Frontier Model
The most capable AI models available at any given time (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3, etc.).

---

## G

### Ground Truth
The verified correct solution for a task, used to evaluate AI-generated solutions.

---

## M

### Merge
The process of integrating changes from one Git branch into another. Tasks are merged into main after approval.

### Metadata
Structured information about a task: ID, title, difficulty, domain, tags, estimated time, author.

---

## P

### PR (Pull Request)
A request to merge changes from your branch into the main branch. PRs are reviewed before acceptance.

### Problem Statement
The description of what a task requires, including requirements, constraints, and examples.

---

## R

### Review
The process where submitted tasks are evaluated for quality, clarity, and appropriateness.

### Revert
Undoing changes in Git, returning code to a previous state.

---

## S

### Starter Code
The template code provided to AI agents as a starting point. Contains function signatures but no implementation.

### Solution
The reference implementation that correctly solves the task. Used to verify test correctness.

---

## T

### Task
A coding challenge designed to test AI agent capabilities. Consists of problem statement, starter code, solution, and tests.

### Test Case
A specific input/output pair that verifies correct task solution. Each task should have multiple test cases.

### Time Complexity
A measure of how an algorithm's runtime scales with input size, expressed in Big O notation (O(n), O(log n), O(n²), etc.).

---

## V

### Validation
Automated checks that verify task structure, metadata, and test correctness before review.

### Verification
Confirming that a solution meets all task requirements and passes all test cases.
