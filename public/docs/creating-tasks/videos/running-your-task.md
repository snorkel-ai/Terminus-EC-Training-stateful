## What You'll Learn

- How to start your task container in interactive mode
- Navigating the task environment
- Testing commands before adding them to your solution
- Debugging environment issues

## Key Commands

### Start Interactive Mode

```bash
harbor run --agent oracle --path harbor_tasks/<task-name> --interactive
```

### Inside the Container

Once inside, you can:
- Navigate the filesystem
- Run your solution commands
- Test that everything works as expected
- Debug any issues

### Exit the Container

```bash
exit
```

## Tips

1. **Test everything manually first** — Run each command of your solution inside the container before writing `solve.sh`

2. **Check file paths** — Verify that all paths in `instruction.md` exist

3. **Verify dependencies** — Make sure all required packages are installed

4. **Note exact commands** — Copy the working commands for your solution file

## Common Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Container won't start | Check Docker is running |
| Permission denied | Run Docker Desktop with admin rights |
| Missing packages | Add to environment/Dockerfile and rebuild |
| Wrong working directory | Check WORKDIR in environment/Dockerfile |
