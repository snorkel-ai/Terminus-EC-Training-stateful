# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with TerminalBench in just a few minutes. This guide covers everything you need to start creating tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Access to the **[Snorkel Expert Platform](https://experts.snorkel-ai.com/)** 
- Joined the **Slack channel** `#ec-terminus-submission`
- Joined the **Notification channel** `#ec-terminus-announcements`
- Set up the **Snorkel CLI** tool
    - Read [Snorkel CLI user guide](/portal/docs/submitting-tasks/cli-user-guide)
    - Using the Snorkel CLI you can:
        - Check submission status
        - Generate your API key
        - Refresh your API key
        - Submit your tasks via CLI instead of platform _(optional)_
        - _and much more!_

## Environment Setup

Once you have the prerequisites taken care of, choose your setup path:

### Option A: Quick Setup with uv (Recommended)

For the fastest setup experience, use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), a modern Python package manager:

**1. Install uv:**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**2. Install Harbor (Python 3.12 and 3.13 are supported):**
```bash
uv tool install harbor==0.1.25 --python 3.13
```

**3. Configure your API keys:**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-portkey-api-key>
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.portkey.ai/v1
```

> **Tip:** Add these to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` for persistence.

**4. You're ready!** to start working and submitting your tasks! 

> **Note:** You still need [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (v24.0.0+) installed and running.

### Option B: Manual Setup

If you prefer a traditional pip installation or need more control, follow these steps:

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows Users: Install WSL2 First</strong></summary>

If you're on Windows, you need to set up WSL2 before installing Docker.

**1. Install WSL2**

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
```powershell
wsl --install
```

When prompted, choose **Ubuntu 22.04** as your Linux distribution.

**2. Install Docker Desktop with WSL2 Integration**

- [Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

During installation, make sure to:
- Enable **"Use WSL 2 based engine"**
- Enable **"Integrate with WSL"** → check Ubuntu

**3. Verify Docker in Ubuntu**

Open your Ubuntu terminal and run:
```bash
docker ps
```

This should run without errors. If you see a permissions error, you may need to restart Docker Desktop or your WSL session.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Step 1: Install Docker Desktop</strong></summary>

Docker is required to run task environments. Note that you need to have at least version 24.0.0 or higher. 

**Install:**
- [Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

**Verify installation:**
```bash
docker --version
# Docker version 24.0.0 or higher
```

**Special macOS Configuration:**

1. Open Docker Desktop → Settings → Advanced
2. Enable: "Allow the default Docker socket to be used (requires password)"
3. If needed, run:
```bash
sudo dscl . create /Groups/docker
sudo dseditgroup -o edit -a $USER -t user docker
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Step 2: Install Harbor</strong></summary>

Harbor is the main task validation and testing framework. 

```bash
pip install harbor==0.1.25
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Step 3: Configure Your API Keys</strong></summary>

You'll receive an API key via email for running agents against your tasks.

**Set environment variables:**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-portkey-api-key>
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.portkey.ai/v1
```

> **Tip:** You can add these to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` for persistence.

<details>
<summary><strong>Step 4: Work On Your First Task</strong></summary>

Follow the complete [Platform Submission Guide](/portal/docs/submitting-tasks/platform-submission) for detailed step-by-step instructions on:

- Downloading the task skeleton template
- Writing task instructions and configuration
- Setting up the Docker environment
- Creating your solution and tests
- Running local validation
- Submitting via ZIP upload to the Snorkel Expert Platform
