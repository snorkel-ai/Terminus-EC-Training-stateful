547d91d9-4d9a-4c06-8f52-a589bfd66fae,"Benchmark CMake-based C++ Ninja Builds: ld.bfd vs lld, LTO, Clang -ftime-trace JSON Report",Build & Dependency Management,needs_work,"Ambiguous phrasing suggests the JSON report comes from Clang -ftime-trace, whereas the task requires a separate JSON summarizing build/rebuild metrics.; Title omits the core requirement to compare full vs incremental rebuild times, which is central to the task's output.","Benchmark CMake/Ninja C++ Builds: ld.bfd vs lld, with/without LTO, use Clang -ftime-trace, JSON report of full vs incremental rebuilds","The revised title keeps the action verb and key technologies while clarifying that Clang -ftime-trace is used during benchmarking and that the JSON report compares full and incremental rebuild times, aligning closely with the task description."
302565c6-1518-4598-8b25-959449e038a6,"Repair CMake-based libvector.so.3: Enforce Export Set, Correct SONAME, Remove RPATH and RUNPATH, Resolve Undefined Symbols",Build & Dependency Management,needs_work,"Ambiguous phrasing: ""Export Set"" could be confused with CMake export sets; it should specify exported symbols; Modifier placement: ""CMake-based libvector.so.3"" implies the library is CMake-based rather than the build; clarify it's the CMake build being repaired","Repair CMake build to produce libvector.so.3: Enforce exported symbol set, set correct SONAME, remove RPATH/RUNPATH, resolve undefined symbols","The recommendation clarifies that the task is about fixing the CMake build (not that the library is ""CMake-based"") and explicitly states ""exported symbol set"" to avoid confusion with CMake's export sets. All core requirements (SONAME, RPATH/RUNPATH, undefined symbols) are preserved."
ef97f6d0-15e0-48df-9ea3-af07d2d0c965,"Implement a Go CI Release Pipeline for linux/amd64 and linux/arm64 Cross-Compilation, Deterministic Tarballs, SBOM, Signing, Local Publish, and Install and Signature Verification",Build & Dependency Management,needs_work,"Possible ambiguity: 'Go CI Release Pipeline' can be read as a pipeline written in Go rather than a CI pipeline for a Go project; Missing 'checksums', which the task explicitly requires generating; Scope detail missing: does not indicate the target is a Go CLI; “Local Publish” is vague; the task specifies publishing to a local release store","Implement a CI Release Pipeline for a Go CLI: cross-compile linux/amd64, linux/arm64; deterministic tarballs; SBOM, checksums; sign; publish to local release store; verify signatures","The revision clarifies that the pipeline is for a Go CLI (not written in Go), adds the required checksums, and specifies publishing to a local release store. It remains action-driven, captures all core outputs, and avoids ambiguity."
4f8bba66-220c-409c-bc32-faacbc258a09,"Configure Multi-Module Gradle Kotlin DSL for Offline Local Maven Builds, Dependency Locking and Verification, and Reproducible JDK 17 Shaded JAR",Build & Dependency Management,needs_work,"The phrase 'Offline Local Maven Builds' is misleading—this task uses Gradle, not Maven as the build tool. It should specify offline builds against a pre-seeded local Maven repository.","Configure Multi-Module Gradle Kotlin DSL for Offline Builds Against a Pre-Seeded Local Maven Repository, Dependency Locking/Verification, and a Reproducible JDK 17 Shaded Fat JAR","The current title could be read as configuring Maven builds, while the task is about Gradle building offline using a local Maven repository. The recommendation clarifies the offline build context and preserves the key scope: Gradle (Kotlin DSL), dependency locking/verification, and a reproducible JDK 17 shaded fat JAR."
