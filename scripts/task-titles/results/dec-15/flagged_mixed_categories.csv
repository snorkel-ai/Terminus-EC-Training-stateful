1628ebe2-8742-4b51-b41b-256e4cf27820,"Configure CMake and CPack .deb and .rpm Packaging with Split -dbg, Validate with dpkg-deb and rpm",Build & Dependency Management,needs_work,"Uses Debian-specific '-dbg' naming; RPM debug packages are typically '-debuginfo', so the title is inaccurate for RPM.; Phrase 'with Split -dbg' is ambiguous and doesn’t clearly state it's a split debug symbols subpackage.","Configure CMake/CPack to build .deb and .rpm packages with a split debug symbols subpackage (-dbg/-debuginfo), validate with dpkg-deb and rpm","Including both '-dbg' and '-debuginfo' makes the title accurate for Debian and RPM ecosystems, and explicitly calling it a split debug symbols subpackage removes ambiguity while keeping the action, scope, and key technologies clear."
6287b90a-760f-4c75-bb7d-0f4dd44589cd,"Replace Autotools with Meson and Ninja, Add Subproject Wrap and pkg-config, Cross-Compile armv7 hard-float",Build & Dependency Management,needs_work,"Ambiguous 'Add ... pkg-config' phrasing—unclear whether to generate a .pc file or just use pkg-config; Cross-compile target phrasing 'armv7 hard-float' could be clearer by specifying armv7hf; Missing the key method for cross-compilation (Meson cross file), which is central to the task",Replace Autotools with Meson/Ninja; add a Meson subproject wrap; generate a pkg-config file; cross-compile ARMv7 hard-float (armv7hf) with a Meson cross file,"The current title captures the general scope but leaves room for misinterpretation. Explicitly stating 'generate a pkg-config file' clarifies the deliverable, adding 'armv7hf' improves specificity of the target, and mentioning the Meson cross file names the core cross-compilation mechanism used in the task."
e0650f37-e473-471d-a3c6-c3529e037766,Implement Python CSV E.164 Phone Normalization and Invalid Logging,Data Processing & Scripting,needs_work,"Ambiguous phrasing: 'Invalid Logging' can be read as logging that is invalid rather than logging invalid phone entries.; Telegraphic wording ('Python CSV ...') doesn’t clearly state it’s a Python script processing a CSV, which slightly obscures scope.","Implement a Python script to parse a CSV, normalize phone numbers to E.164 using a default country code, and log invalid entries","The recommended title clarifies that this is a Python script operating on a CSV, explicitly states E.164 normalization with a default country code, and removes the ambiguity around 'Invalid Logging' by specifying that invalid entries are logged."
4399f143-11d9-4bd4-8ef0-02cc31d77cea,Implement Python CLI for Recursive app.log and gzipped ISO8601 Session Aggregation into Deterministic JSON,Data Processing & Scripting,needs_work,"Ambiguous phrasing suggests the ISO8601 sessions are gzipped rather than the logs (""gzipped ISO8601 Session Aggregation"").; Missing the per-user scope, which is central to the task.; Unclear action on logs (""for Recursive app.log..."")—doesn't explicitly state parsing/decompression.","Implement Python CLI to recursively parse app.log and .gz logs, aggregate per-user ISO8601 session durations, and output deterministic JSON","The revised title clarifies that the logs (not the sessions) are gzipped, explicitly states per-user aggregation, and uses clear actions (parse/aggregate/output) to reflect the actual task scope."
b8730aa5-c47e-49e9-86e7-f3dfd237606c,Diagnose and Resolve Cargo Workspace rustc and cargo Version Incompatibility,Debugging & Troubleshooting,needs_work,"Ambiguous phrasing suggests rustc and cargo are incompatible with each other, rather than the toolchain being too old for the workspace's dependency requirements; Missing the key context that this is a build failure caused by an outdated toolchain relative to pinned dependencies; Noun chain ('Cargo Workspace rustc and cargo Version Incompatibility') is unclear; using 'toolchain' would clarify scope",Diagnose and Resolve Cargo Workspace Build Failure Due to Outdated rustc/cargo Toolchain or Re-resolve Crate Versions,"The revised title makes it clear that the failure is caused by a toolchain-versus-dependency version mismatch in a Cargo workspace and highlights the two resolution paths, matching the task description."
f5feee22-f568-4735-8a34-028e59dede46,Build a PATH Hijacking Auditor and Temp Sticky-Bit Hardener,Security & Cryptography,needs_work,"Title suggests only auditing of PATH, but the task also requires remediation/hardening (fixing/removing unsafe entries and safely reordering PATH).",Build a PATH Hijacking Auditor and Hardener with Temp Sticky-Bit Enforcement,"The recommended title makes clear that the utility both audits and remediates PATH issues while keeping the temp sticky-bit requirement explicit, matching the described fix and reorder actions."
7f522043-b113-4538-a9f8-5e8917474d9c,"Implement a Fault-Tolerant HTTP Proxy with Circuit Breaker, Hedged Jittered Exponential Backoff, Stale Cache Fallback, Idempotency Keys, and /metrics",Software Engineering & Development,needs_work,Conflates two distinct mechanisms: 'Hedged Jittered Exponential Backoff' suggests hedging is part of backoff rather than a separate feature (request hedging + jittered exponential backoff).,"Implement a Fault-Tolerant HTTP Proxy with Circuit Breaker, Jittered Exponential Backoff, Request Hedging, Stale Cache Fallback, Idempotency Keys, and /metrics","The title is action-driven and mostly accurate, but the phrase 'Hedged Jittered Exponential Backoff' is ambiguous and could mislead. Separating 'Request Hedging' from 'Jittered Exponential Backoff' clarifies the scope and aligns precisely with the task description."
ddbd2da2-8b98-4f83-b540-7aaeeadcbf1b,Configure AWS CLI v2 IAM Identity Center (SSO) Multi-Account Profiles with Custom Session Durations,System Setup & Configuration,needs_work,"Ambiguous phrasing: missing 'for' or 'with' between 'AWS CLI v2' and 'IAM Identity Center (SSO)', making the relationship unclear and reading like a single compound noun.",Configure AWS CLI v2 for IAM Identity Center (SSO) multi-account profiles with custom session durations,"Adding 'for' clarifies that the task is configuring the AWS CLI to use IAM Identity Center (SSO), improving readability without changing scope or technologies."
